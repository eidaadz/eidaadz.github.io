This website contains a multilevel modeling project.

Preliminary analysis

Multiple linear regression, MLR

Multilevel null model
  The Variance Partition Coefficient (VPC) is calculated by dividing the between hospital variance by the sum of the between and within hospital variances.
  VPC is similar with ICC (Intraclass correlation coefficient). According to Robson & Pevalin (2016) the accepted value of ICC  ranges from 0 - 1.

  Determining the design effect:
    Design Effect = 1 + (nc - 1)ICC

  Design effect greater than 2.0 indicates that the analysis can be proceed with MLM (Leckie, 2010)
